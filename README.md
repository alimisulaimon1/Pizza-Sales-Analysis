$204.47k revenue per quarter

## Conclusion and Recommendations:
- The fourth quarter recorded the lowest order. this can be attributed to end of summer, as people are more likely to stay inside during winter
- All the months in the 4th quarter except November peaked past the average order per month. this may be due to Black Friday and Thanksgiving
- The end of the week (Thursdayâ€“Saturday) saw higher orders in comparison to other daysof the week
- The revenue trend is similar to the order trend except quarter 3, which recorded lower revenue as compared to quarter 2
- Peak periods for orders during the weekdays were between 12-1 pm and 5-6 p.m., which coincided with lunch breaks and the end of work. the peak period fell between 5-8 pm during the weekend 
- The Class Deluxe was the most ordered pizza. Despite this, it only manages ($38.2k) in revenue behind Thai Chicken ($43.4k), Barbecue Chicken ($42.8k), and Califonia Chicken ($41.4k).
- The Brie Currie Pizza was 480 times less than the average (680). it averages $23.65 revenue across all sizes, making it the most expensive type

# Recommendation:

For a deep dive into the analytics, the folling 
- XL and XXL should be scrapped because they contribute less to the order and revenue
